# 99Tech Code Challenge #1 #

Hi, My name is Ly. I am applying for Frontend developer position. And this is my code challenge submit.

## How to run
- Problem1:

`node ./sumToN.js`

- Problem2: I use Vite so the project could be run by following these command lines:

`npm run install`

`npm run dev`

+ Note: I use some JS feature such as: throttle to reduce the number of API calls to fetch latest prices from server, closure to store data into memory for other usages.

## Usage:
- Tokens: https://github.com/Switcheo/token-icons.git
- Vite: https://vite.dev/
