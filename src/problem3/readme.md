Here are some of the computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns that I could found in the code block:

1. getPriority function look quite complicated, I would prefer to store it as key value or object instead.

2. in WalletRow generate function, there is the usage of formattedAmount={balance.formatted} => the map should be come from formattedBalances. Besides, we can define TypeScript type for sortedBalances and formattedBalances when creating them.

3. the sortedBalances function can be minimized to make the code cleaner and shorter. Also, at the first filter function, there is no usage of balancePriority but lhsPriority, which cause syntax error.

4. formattedBalances run seperately is unefficiency. It will rerun everytime props change, we can caculated them together with sortedBalances to take advantage of useMemo function.

5. In the WalletRow list, key should not use as index, it will force React to rerender WalletRow everytime sortedBalances changes. We can use balance.currency to map as key to leverage React Virtual Dom caching.

=> I updated the refactor code version in main.js file. Please take a look, thank you.
